## Demo SSG

This demo shows how the plugin can be used in combination with a Server Side Generated app. I use this combination on my own website, [vernaillen.dev](https://vernaillen.dev), because I want the website content to be indexed by search engines, and still have the flexinility to add client side functionality.
